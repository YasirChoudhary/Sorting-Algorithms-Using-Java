The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the
minimum element (Considering ascending order) from unsorted part and
putting it at the begining. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in
a given array.

1) The subarray which is already sorted.
2) Remainig subarray which is unsorted.

In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element
(Considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray 
is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.
